# Introduction

This repository helps to restore or configure a new machine with one single shell script

# Script Files 

| File | Type |  Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `install.sh` | Shell Script  | starter script  |
| `macos.sh` | Shell Script | Script to run on mac os| 
| `linux.sh` | Shell Script | To run on Linux machine (Fedora) | 

# Configuration files
| File | Type |  Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `software.yaml`  | yaml file | List of softwares to be installed | 
| `config/.tmux.conf`|  tmux  | tmux configuration file| 
| `config/.wezterm.lua`| terminal | wezterm lua terminal config file | 
| `config/.zshrc`| profile | shell profile| 
| `config/starship.toml`| shell Prompt | shell prompt | 


# Versions Tested on
| OS | Version |  Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mac | Ventura | | 
| mac  | Sonoma | | 
| linux | Fedora | Virtual Machine & Docker | 
| Linux | Arch | Docker |

**`Note`**: The script works on Ubuntu machine but the apt package manager does not pull latest neovim version. 


# Docker Images
If you want to install the script on a `throw away` machine then try on docker images. Here are the steps to be followed. Below example is on fedora, but the steps pretty much remain the same on any version

- Install docker on your host machine. 
- Pull the image from docker hub (requires sign-in)
  
```bash
$> docker pull fedora

# to check if the image is downloaded on your system
$> docker images
```
- Setup the container using the following commands
```bash
  $> docker run --name test -d -i -t fedora /bin/bash

  # check the processes
  $> docker ps

```
- finally execute the following command to login to the container. Replace "container id" shown from the `docker ps` command above
  
```bash
  $> docker exec -it container-id /bin/bash
```

- You will dropped into this container as root. This script will work fine as a root user but on a real machine/virtual enviornment, never run any script as root.



# Script Workflow
The main script `install.sh` will guide through the setup processes. The workflow is as follows

- 



# Docker
I wanted to test this on another machine apart so better option was to install docker and try on various "throw away" machine.
Next step is to automate this as part of my shellscript.

The list of things I did was 

- Install docker desktop on mac (.dmg file)
- Pull docker ubuntu image and view them

- Set the container and connect 
```bash
  # setup the container
  $> docker run --name test -d -i -t ubuntu /bin/sh
  # you can see the container active using
  $> docker ps
  # get into the container
  $> docker exec -it container-id /bin/sh

```
- Once inside the image then do the following (to be automated)
```bash
  # update the image
  $> apt update

  # install git to clone the repo
  # will have to make this repo public
  $> apt install git -y

  # create a folder for cloning the repo
  $> mkdir project; cd project

  # cloning the repo
  $> git clone https://github.com/rvbug/.dotfiles.git

  $> cd .dotfiles
  $> /bin/sh install.sh
 
```
