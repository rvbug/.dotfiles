# Basic Info

## Keyboard

### Windows, Panes

→  c-w v , s for splitting the panes 

→ c-w c - close window 

→ c-w o - close all except the current one

→ c-w then use hjkl for movement

### Movement

b - move backward to start of a word

w - move forward 

e - move to the end of the word

fn → search for the 1st occurrence of “n”

tn or Fn → search backwards for “n”

(  ) & { } → jump to next and previous sentence

% → move between { } or ( ) e.g inside a code

 “zz”, “zb” and “zt” → current, previous line to the top of  screen

### Nice ones to know

:buffers, :ls, :files → shows list of all open buffers

“*” & “#” → to search word under the cursor forward and backward

:jumps → vim keep track of the jumps and cntrl-o &  cntrl-I to move between jumps

:echo &undolevels - displays undo and setting is done using :set undolevels

gQ to go to Ex more and exit using :visual mode

### Registers

```markdown
# Registers

`"ap` in command mode and `Cntl+R a` => patse whatever is availble in the a resgiter
try for all register including a-z,0-9

a-z => are called names register
"ayw => yanks a word and store inside a register a. Paste using "ap or insert mode "cntrl-r a"

""p -> stores last text you yanked or deleted or changed where p is the unnamed register
to look at all text stored in the register - use ":register" command

If u use "5p then pressing "." will keep moving to the 6, 7 8th register.

Changes less than one line gets stored in "-p or "cntrl-r -"

Read only register -> . stores last inserted text, : last cmd executed, % name of current file
Alternate file register -> #

Expression register -> "=@a cntrl+R =@a

Copying from external programs => "* and =+ - they are interchangable. To use in command mode = "*p and "+p
This is connected to your clipboard +clipboard. If you have +xterm_clipboard use unnamed or unnamedplus options

Blackhole register "_ -> "_dd it is more like /dev/null

Use :register or :register a 1 z -> to view all the content under a, 1 and z

:put 1 -> puts the content of the register on the buffer
```

### Additional Info about Registers

You can think of registers as places where you can read or write some text. I like to think about them as Vim’s clipboards.

• `:registers` or `:reg` - Display the content of your registers.

• `"<reg>` - This keystroke *specifies* the register `<reg>` to be read or written.

- To write the register `a`:
    1. Hit `"a` in NORMAL mode to specify what register you want to write on.
    2. Yank, change, or delete some content (for example by using `dd` in NORMAL mode) to write it to `a`.
- To read the register `a`:
    1. Hit `"a` in NORMAL mode to specify what register you want to read.
    2. Use a put keystroke in NORMAL mode (for example `p` or `P`) to spit out the content of the register in your current buffer.

`clipboard+=unnamedplus` → Using a put command without specifying any register will spit the content of the unnamed register by default. But you might have this line in your `vimrC`

- Expression Register
    1. Switch to INSERT mode and hit the keystroke `CTRL+r =`. You’ll move to Vim’s command-line.
    2. From there, you can type any Vimscript expression you want, like `system("ls")` we saw above, or `4+4`.
    3. Hit `ENTER` to run the expression, and you’ll see the output of the shell command `ls` directly inserted in your buffer!
    
    It’s useful to evaluate some custom functions you’ve defined while staying in insert mode. If you use Neovim, you can use the function `luaeval()` to evaluate some Lua too.
    

### Macros

qa → record a macro in the register “a” and “q” to stop recording

@a → run the macro or @@ to run the last macro

:2, 3 normal @a → to run macro between lines 2 and 3

### Search & Replace

/^h and /h$ → search for h start and end of the line

 /[^0-9] - match all char without digit, for negative search use brackets

/^abc → matches the first abc in the line and /^[abc] → does not match any char except for a, b c

counts → multiple search 

- /[0-9]\{2\} - matches 2 digit numbers
- /[0-9]\{2,\} - matches 2 or more

\” [^”]\+ ” → any char which is not a double quote “ and \+ means one or more

\”0” → zero - a special char

use \v if you want to avoid lot of brackets

### Global command

/g/pattern/command /g/const/d → delete all lines matching “const”

### Custom Commands

```
:command! GimmeDate echo call("strftime", [<args>])
:GimmeDate "%F"
" 2020-01-01
:GimmeDate "%H:%M"
" 11:30

```

### Variable Scope

```
g:           Global variable -> let g:lunch="kanji" or let lunch="kanji"
{nothing}    Global variable
b:           Buffer-local variable -> available in the current buffer -> echo b:varname
w:           Window-local variable -> available only in that window -> echo w:varname
t:           Tab-local variable -> available only in that window
s:           Sourced Vimscript variable
l:           Function local variable
a:           Function formal parameter variable
v:           Built-in Vim variable -> :h vim-variable or :h :v

```

### Functions

First letter of the function name should be in Caps

calling a function using :call command 

if you want to output the return value use the following

echo call(”func_name”, [”args”])

# Vim (Advanced)

### Info

vim.o → general settings

vim.wo → windows settings

vim.opt → set global, windows and buffer settings

vim.g → mapleader and plugin var

[vim.bo](http://vim.bo) → buffer local variable

vim.env → env variables

vim.fn → meta table, call vim function, user function

every options available in global module 

we also have meta-acceesor-toaccess all options

### Basics

:echo 

:echom → stores in :message

Options - with toggle and with values

:set number and :set nonumber

:set number! - toggle on and off

:set number? - status

:set numberwidth=10  number → 2 cmds in one line

:set wrap and nowrap

:set relativenumber

### Mapping & Non Recursive

commenting is not allowed here

:map x dd → x will delete the line and unmap to remove this key mapping

:map <keyname> action → keyname is special char (<space> , <c-b> etc)

:nnoremap , inoremap, vnoremap - non recurrsive mapping

,Some keys we do not use  -, H, L, <space>, <cr>, <bs>

Each of the `*map` commands has a `*noremap`counterpart that ignores other mappings:

If you want to be specific then we can use nmap, imap and vmap for normal, insert and visual mode

We can also set local leader - let `maplocalleader` = “\\” - This is meant to be a prefix for mappings that only take effect for certain types of files, like Python files or HTML files

Global Leader - let mapleader = <space>

:nnoremap <leader>d dd

`MYVIMRC` → echo the path 

:nnoremap <leader>ev :vsplit $MYVIMRC<cr>

:map → shows all mapping

:map , → shows all mapping using ,

`:nnoremap <leader>sv :source $MYVIMRC<cr>`

`:inoremap <esc> <nop>` → disables the escape key in insert mode by telling Vim to perform `<nop>` (no operation) instead. Now you *have*  to use your `jk` mapping to exit insert mode.

### **Abbreviations**

`:iabbrev adn and` → converts to and in insert mode

### Buffer Local and Mapping

`:nnoremap <buffer> <leader>x dd` → this is in effect only on that buffer where it was defined

In general, when you create a mapping that only applies to specific buffers you should use `<localleader>` instead of `<leader>`.

It's even more important when you're writing a plugin for other people to use. The convention of using `<localleader>` for local mappings will prevent your plugin from overwriting someone else's `<leader>`
 mapping that they've painstakingly burned into their fingers over time

There are certain mapping which can be set on a per-buffer basis using  `:setlocal wrap`. The global one can be set using 

### Auto command

Autocommands are a way to tell Vim to run certain commands whenever certain events happen.

Vim creates files as soon as you edit them. Run the following command: `:autocmd BufNewFile * :write` or **:w**

```
:autocmd BufNewFile * :write
         ^          ^ ^
         |          | |
         |          | The command to run --> you can't use special characters like <cr> in the command.
         |          |
         |          A "pattern" to filter the event.
         |
         The "event" to watch for.
```

`:autocmd BufNewFile *.txt :write` → only for .txt file

`:autocmd BufWritePre *.html :normal gg=G` → formats the html document when clicked on save

`:normal gg=G` will tell Vim to reindent the current file 

Multiple events can fire too → `:autocmd BufWritePre,BufRead *.html :normal gg=G` → indent when read and write file 

`:autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.html setlocal nowrap` → This will turn line wrapping off whenever you're working on an HTML file.

### Auto command group

```
:augroup testgroup
:    autocmd BufWrite * :echom "Foo"
:    autocmd BufWrite * :echom "Bar"
:augroup END
```

```
augroup filetype_html
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType html nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>f Vatzf
augroup END
```

### **File type events**

This event is fired whenever Vim sets a buffer's `filetype`

### **Operator-Pending Mappings**

Movement mapping → `:onoremap p i(` → remember di( will delete inside the paren () so now with this map press dp it will do the same deletion

The `onoremap`command tells Vim that when it's waiting for a movement to give to an operator and it sees `p`, it should treat it like `i(`.

`:onoremap in( :<c-u>normal! f(vi(<cr>` → print foo(bar) and now if you are near p and press cin → it will delete the bar without going to that cursor

<c-u> → we will come back to what this is - It is to make the mappings work in all cases

normal! → Will come back later but for now - it is the command used to simulate pressing keys in normal mode. so normal! dddd - will delete 2 likes just like in normal mode

`F)vi(` → `F)`: Move backwards to the nearest `)` character &  `vi(`: Visually select inside the parentheses.

**Rules**

- If your operator-pending mapping ends with some text visually selected, Vim will operate on that text.
- Otherwise, Vim will operate on the text between the original cursor position and the new position.

## **Cheatsheet**

![Screenshot 2022-05-02 at 11.20.53 PM.png](NeoVim%200a63ae0bd6194e288b7dc535d2626e34/Screenshot_2022-05-02_at_11.20.53_PM.png)

## Basic **keys and navigations**

- Verbs - action we take & and they can be performed on nouns
    - **`d`**: delete
    - **`c`**: change
    - **`y`**: yank (copy)
    - **`v`**: visually select (V for line vs. character)
- Modifiers - used before nouns
    - **`i`**: inside
    - **`a`**: around
    - **`NUM`**: number (e.g.: 1, 2, 10)
    - **`t`**: searches for something and stops before it
    - **`f`**: searches for that thing and lands on it
    - **`/`**: find a string (literal or regex)
- Nouns -are objects you do something *to*
    - **`w`**: word
    - **`s`**: sentence
    - **`p`**: paragraph
    - **`t`**: tag (think HTML/XML)
    - **`b`**: block (think programming)
- examples  using verbs, modifiers and nouns
    
    **c**hange **i**nside **w**ords - ciw, 
    
    delete around words - daw
    
    yank inside para - yip
    
    change till } from {  ct}
    
- Other important keys
    
    ZZ → Save and exit the file
    
    fp → jumps to p
    
    tp → jumps before p
    
    **`)`**: move forward one sentence
    
    **`}`**: move forward one paragraph
    
    **`Ctrl-i`** jump to your previous navigation location - between files
    
    **`Ctrl-o`**: jump back to where you were - between files
    
    vi} → visual select inside }
    
    v2i} → select inside the 2nd level }
    
    vwwy → visually select 2 words (or use v2wy)
    

## O**ptions**

vim’s behaviour can be changed by changing the options. It is like a variable accepts boolean, strings or numbers

- `:set no<option>` - Unset the option.
- `:set <option>!` - Toggle the option.
- `:set <option>?` - Return the option’s value.
- `:set <option>=<value>` - Set a value `<value>` (string or number).
- `:set <option>+=<value>` - Add the value `<value>` for a number option, append a string `<value>` for a string option.
- `:set <option>-=<value>` - Subtract the value `<value>` for a number option, delete the string `<value>` for a string option.
- `:set <option>&` - Reset the option to its default value.
    
    What should be the leader key ? spacebar? or d(like softice)
    
    Other good to have keys are
    

## Open files

**Vim representation of open files - 4 ways - windows, buffers, tabs and argument lists**

- **Buffer** - command :buffers → 1 %a + "init.vim" line 2 where 1 is id, active, file name and cursor is in line 2
    
    *(note: You can as well know what’s the current buffer displayed with the flag `%` just before its state)*
    
    file in memory. If you close a window containing a buffer, the buffer is still there, *hidden. There are 3 states of buffers :→*
    
    - *active* - The buffer is displayed in a window.
    - *hidden* - The buffer is not displayed, but it exists and the file is still open.
    - *inactive* - The buffer is not displayed and *empty*. It’s not linked to any file.
    - To show all buffers :ls! or :buffers!
    - **Navigation**
        
        To navigate through the buffer list, you can use these commands:
        
        - `:buffer <ID_or_name>`Move to the buffer using its ID or its name.
        - `:bnext` or `:bn` - Move to the next buffer.
        - `:bprevious` or `:bp` - Move to the previous buffer.
        - `:bfirst` or `:bf` - move to the first buffer.
        - `:blast` or `:bl` - move to the last buffer.
        - `CTRL-^` - switch to the alternate buffer. It’s indicated in your buffer list with the symbol `#`.
        - `<ID>CTRL-^` - Switch to a specific buffer with ID `<ID>`. For example, `75CTRL-^` switch to the buffer with ID 75.
        
        You can as well apply a command to all buffers using `:bufdo <command>`.
        
        - If you create a window, a buffer will be created automatically (see below).
        - `:badd <filename>` - Add `<filename>` to the buffer list.
        - `:bdelete <ID_or_name>` - Delete a buffer by ID or name. You can specify more than one ID or name separated with spaces to delete multiple buffers.
        - `:1,10bdelete` - Delete buffers from ID 1 to 10 included.
        - `:%bdelete` - Delete all buffers.
- **Windows**
    
    A window in Vim to display the content of a buffer. When you close the window, the buffer stays open.When you open Vim, one window with one empty buffer are automatically created.
    
    - **Navigation**
        - `CTRL-W s` - Split the current window horizontally.
        - `CTRL-W v` - Split the current window vertically.
        - `CTRL-W n` - Split the current windows horizontally and edit a new file.
        - `CTRL-W ^` - Split the current with the *alternate file* (buffer with the `#` indicator in your buffer list).
        
        Moving from 1 window to another
        
        - `CTRL-W <Down>` or `CTRL-W j`
        - `CTRL-W <Up>` or `CTRL-W k`
        - `CTRL-W <Left>` or `CTRL-W h`
        - `CTRL-W <right>` or `CTRL-W l`
        - `CTRL-W r` - Rotate the windows.
        - `CTRL-W x` - Exchange with the next window
        - 
        - `CTRL-W =` - Resize windows for them to fit on the screen with the same size.
        - `CTRL-W -` - Decrease window’s height.
        - `CTRL-W +` - Increase window’s height.
        - `CTRL-W <` - Decrease window’s width.
        - `CTRL-W >` - Increase window’s width.
    
- **Tabs**
    
    We can see tabs as a container for a bunch of windows
    
    - **Navigation**
        - `tabnew` or `:tabe` - Open a new tab.
        - `:tabclose` or `:tabc` - Close the current tab.
        - `:tabonly` or `:tabo` - Close every other tab except the current one.
        - `gt` - `g`o to the next `t`ab.
        - `gT` - `g`o to the previous tab.
- **args list (less frequently used)**
    
    it as a *stable subset* of the buffer list
    
    - Navigation
        - `:args` - Display the arglist.
        - `:argadd` - Add file to the arglist.
        - `:argdo` - Execute a command on every file in the arglist.
        
        To edit the files in the arglist, you can use these commands:
        
        - `:next` - Move to the next file in the arglist.
        - `:prev` - Move to the previous file in the arglist.
        - `:first` - Move to the first file in the arglist.

## **Mapping keys**

- `:nmap` - Create new mapping for NORMAL mode.
- `:imap` - Create new mapping for INSERT mode.
- `:xmap` - Create new mapping for VISUAL mode.
- `:cmap` - Create new mapping for COMMAND-LINE mode.
    - example to map dd to w. hit w to delete line → nmap w dd
    - n now v to w to move between words → nmap v w but u use v n it deletes ie recurssive mapping done
- so to avoid this use →
    1. Map `w` to `dd`
    2. Map `v` to the motion made by `w` *before* its mapping with `dd`.
- 
- `:nnoremap` - Create mapping for NORMAL mode (non recursive)
- `:inoremap` - Create mapping for INSERT mode (non recursive)
- `:vnoremap` - Create mapping for VISUAL mode (non recursive)
- `:cnoremap` - Create mapping for COMMAND-LINE mode (non recursive)

- special chars
- `<space>` for `SPACE`
- `<c-w>` for `CTRL+w`.
- `<cr>` for `c`arriage `r`eturn (`ENTER`).
- `<esc>` for `ESC`.
- **help**
    
    To see the complete list, run the command `:help key-notation`
    
- **leader key namespace**
    
    If you want to create new mappings, you should use a special key called the *leader key*. It’s a way to create mapping namespaces: first, you use your leader key, then you use your keystroke. Thanks to the leader key, your new keystroke will never conflict with the default Vim keystrokes.
    
    To set up your leader key, you need to set the variable mapleader. Here’s an example:
    
    ```bash
    let mapleader = "<space>"
    nnoremap <leader>bn :bn<cr> ;buffer next
    nnoremap <leader>tn gt ;new tab
    
    ```
    
    The keystrokes `<space> bn` will move to the next buffer, and `<space> tn` will move to the next tab. Notice that when you want to map a keystroke to a command, you need to add `<cr>` at the end exactly like you would type `ENTER` (or carriage return) to execute the command. Awesomeness!
    

## Jump

There are special motions in Vim called jump-motion. `G` - jumps

Moving using `k` or `j` is not considered as a jump-motion.

- **Jump list**
    
    Each time we use a jump motion, the position of the cursor before the jump is saved in the ***jump list***. 
    
    You can move through this jump list with the following keystrokes:
    
    - `CTRL-o` - Go to the previous (`o`lder) cursor position.
    - `CTRL-i` - Go to the next cursor position (`i` is near `o`).
    - To display your jump list, use the command `:jumps`
- **change list**
    
    every insert using insert mode, the position of your cursor is saved in the change list.
    
    navigation can be done by
    
    - `g;` - Jump to the next change.
    - `g,`Jump to the previous change
- **jumping between methods (in code)**
    - `[m` - move to the start of a method.
    - `]m` - move to the end of a method.
    - :changes → shows the change list
- **Help section**
    - `:help jump-motions`
    - `:help jumplist`
    - `:help changelist`
- 

## **Keystroke Automation**

- single repeat
    - `.` - Repeat the last change.
    - `@:` - Repeat the last command executed.
- Help section
    
    • `:help single-repeat`
    
- **Complex repeat - macros**
    1. `q<lowecase_letter>` - Begin recording keystrokes in a register. You can think of a register as a place in memory, or as a clipboard.
    2. Every keystrokes you’ll do onward will be saved.
    3. `q` - Stop the recording.
    4. `@<lowercase_letter>` - Execute the keystrokes you’ve recorded.
- help section
    
    • `:help complex-repeat`
    

## Command History

You can access the history of your Ex commands directly in Vim: 

- `q:` - Open command line history.
- `q/` and `q?` - Open search history.
- `CTRL+f` - Open command line history while in COMMAND LINE mode.
- `:history :` - Command-line history.
- `:history /` or `:history ?` - Search history.
- **Note:** If you don’t like the keystroke `CTRL+f`  to open the command line history, you can change it by changing the value of the option `cedit`
. The value by default is `^f`(`CTRL+f`).
- help section
    - `:help cmdline-window`
    - `:help 'history'`

## Undo tree

Vim allows you as well to save all these undos in a file. To add in vimrc file

```bash
" save undo trees in files
set undofile
set undodir=~/.vim/undo

" number of undo saved
set undolevels=10000
```

You’ll even be able to search in the entire undo tree for a piece of content you want to find back!

## Plugins

Plugin manager vimplug - installation required

```bash
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

### Installation sample

For example, if you want to install the plugin `vim-bbye`, you need to:

1. Find the Github repository of the plugin, in that case `https://github.com/moll/vim-bbye`.
2. Take the username and the repository’s name from the url: `moll/vim-bbye`.
3. Add `Plug 'moll/vim-bbye'` between `call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')` and `call plug#end()`.
4. Source your `.vimrc` with the command `:source <path_to_vimrc>`. If your current buffer is already your vimrc , you can run `:source %`.
5. Run `:PlugInstall`.
6. Your plugin is installed!

To update every plugins you have, you can use the command `:PlugUpdate`

## g keystrokes

You can use these keystrokes in NORMAL mode:

- `gf` - Edit the file located at the filepath under your cursor.
    - You can use `CTRL+W CTRL+F` to open the file in a new window.
    - It can open the URL under your cursor if you have the plugin `netrw`.
- `gx` - Open the file located at the filepath under your cursor.
    - It will use the default application used by your OS for this filetype.
    - It works with URLs too. It will open your favorite browser and load the website.
    - It only works if you have the plugin `netrw`.
- `gi` - Move to the last insertion you did and switch to INSERT mode.
    - Pretty useful if you stopped your editing to look at some other file.
    - It uses marks under the hood: more on that later in this article.
- `gv` - Start VISUAL mode and use the selection made during the last VISUAL mode.
- `gn` - Select the match of your last search:
    1. Move to the last searched match.
    2. Switch to VISUAL mode (if you weren’t in VISUAL mode already).
    3. Select the match.
    4. You can continue to hit `n` (or `gn`) to select the area between the current match and the next match.
- `gI` - Insert text at the beginning of the line, no matter what the first characters are.
    - The keystroke `I` insert text *just before the first non-blank characters* of the line.
- `ga` - Print the `a`scii value of the character under the cursor in decimal, hexadecimal or octal.
- `gu` - Lowercase using a motion (for example, `guiw`).
- `gU` - Uppercase using a motion (for example, `gUiw`).

### Ranges

Every  command will accept a range.

- `<number>` - Any number `<number>` in your range refers to a line number.
- `.` - Represent the current line (often the default range).
- `$` - Represent the last line of the current buffer.
- `%` - Represent the entire file (same as `1,$`).
- `` - Use the last selection you’ve made during the last VISUAL mode.

For example, using the command `:d`:

- `:1,40d` - Delete line 1 to 40 included.
- `:2,$d` - Delete every line from the second one till the end of the file.
- `:.,$d` - Delete every line from the current one till the end of the file.
- `:%d` - Delete every line.
- Math → let’s imagine your cursor is on the line 60: the range `.,.+10`will be equivalent to the range `60,70`
- **Visual mode and Ranges**
    
    If you switch to COMMAND-LINE mode after doing some selection in VISUAL mode, you’ll see these two symbols appearing: `'<` and `'>` with a comma `,` in between. This is a range too!
    
    The symbols `'<` represents the first line you’ve selected and `'>` the last line. Each of these are marks; again, we’ll see more about marks below.
    
    In practice, the ranges `'<,'>` and `*` are synonym, but you’ll have more flexibility with the first. 
    
    For example, you can execute a command from the first line you’ve selected till the end of the file with the range `'<,$`.
    
- Help
    - `:help [range]`
    - `:help v_:`
    - `:help '<`
    - `:help '>`

### QuickFix Buffer

There is **quickfix** list data structure and also quickfix window - which displays this data structure

What happens when you type `:vimgrep hello *`?

1. It will search the pattern “hello” in every file of your working directory.
2. It will populate a quickfix list with every position matching your pattern “hello”.
3. It will move your cursor to the first position of the quickfix list.
4. Other commands (like `:make`or `:grep`) also populate automatically a quickfix list.
5. The quickfix list is often used to display specific errors in a codebase, often spit out from a compiler or a linter
- `:cl` or `:clist` - Display all valid entries of the current quickfix list. You can add a range as argument (only numbers).
- `:cc <number>` - Move to the `<number>`th entry of the current quickfix list.
- `:cnext` or `:cn` - Move to the next entry of the current quickfix list.
- `:cprevious` or `:cp` - Move to the previous entry of the current quickfix list.
- `:cfirst` or `:cfir` - Move to the first entry of the current quickfix list.
- `:clast` or `:clas` - Move to the last entry of the current quickfix list.

**Powerful**

- `:cdo <cmd>` - Execute a command `<cmd>` on each valid entry of the current quickfix list.
- `:cexpr <expr>` or `:cex <expr>` - Create a quickfix list using the result of evaluating the Vimscript expression `<expr>`.
- `:caddexpr <expr>` or `:cadde <expr>` - Appends the result of evaluating the Vimscript expression `<expr>` to the current quickfix list.

**example**

- `:cex []` - Empty the current quickfix list.
- `:cex system("<cmd>")` - Populate your quickfix list with any shell command `<cmd>`. You can try it with `ls` for example.
- now type :cl to see the o/p of last comment

### Quickfix window

What about displaying the current quickfix list in a new buffer? You can do that with the following command:

- `:copen` or `:cope` - Open a window (with a special buffer) to show the current quickfix list.

You can only have one quickfix window open. To move to the position of the selected entry of the quickfix list in the quickfix window, hit `ENTER` or `.cc`.

### Location list

A location list is similar to a quickfix list. In other words, you can have multiple location lists available at the same time (one per window open), but you can only have access to one quickfix list.

To populate your location list you can also use the commands `:lvimgrep`or `:lmake`

- `:lli` or `:llist` - Display all valid entries of the current location list. You can add a range as argument (only numbers).
- `:ll <number>` - Move to the entry `<number>` of the current location list.
- `:lnext` or `:lne` - Move to the next entry of the current quickfix list.

### Regex

Vim has it’s own regex engine (2 of them)

- To have access to *all* regex metacharacters, you can prefix your pattern with `\v` (`v`ery magic).
- To have access to *almost all* regex metacharacters (except `(`, `)` and `|`), use the command `:sm` instead of `:s` (`s`ubstitute `m`agic).
- To have access to *none* of the metacharacters (except `$`), use `:sno` instead of `:s` (`s`ubstitute `no`magic).
- To have access to *none* of the metacharacters, you can prefix your pattern with `\V` (`V`ery nomagic).
- :norm daw → delete a word under the cursor in normal mode - This is amazing
- `:g/useless/norm gu$` → This will lowercase every line containing the pattern `useless`
- Number manipulation
    - `CTRL+a` - Increase *the first digit or number* on the line.
    - `CTRL+x` - Decrease *the first digit or number* on the line.
    
    You can also use these keystrokes in VISUAL mode:
    
    - `g CTRL+a` - Same as `CTRL+a` unless you have several lines selected. In that case, the first number of each line will be *incremented sequentially*.
    - `g CTRL+x` - Same as `CTRL+x` unless you have several lines selected. In that case, the first number of each line will be *decremented sequentially*.

# Additional Detail

**Vim Notes**

Reference : 

:h rtp -> folder structure

:history

:version

+{cmd} -> If you want to open the file hello.txt and immediately execute a command

e.g. vim +%s/pancake/bagel/g hello.txt

Pass -c command above us same as using “+”

vim -o5 hello1.txt hello2.txt -> opens 2 buffers horizontally

set hidden -> to not save buffers

split movement - c+w h, j k

**Buffer & Buffers**

- A buffer is an in-memory space where you can write and edit some text
- When 2 files are being opened using **vim file1 file2**
    - :buffer shows what file is open
    - :buffers shows all buffers opened
    - bnext & bprevious to move between them
    - :buffer 2 -> will go to the 2nd buffer
    - qall -> to close all of them use wqall

**Window**

- It is a view port on a buffer

- vim file.txt -> this opens a buffer displayed through a window

- 

**Tabs**

- It is a collection of windows

- When you close the tab, only the window is closed but not the file
- :tabnew file2 opens a new tab
- :tabnext, :tablets, :tabfirst to move around
- gt or gT or 3gt to move to the next tab or previous one
- vim -p file1.js file2.js file3.js -> to open multiple tabs
- 

**Motion**

init.vim/nvim.lua file

set hlsearch

set incsearch or 	:nohlsearch

“*” - helps in searching the word under cursor

[[      Go to the previous section

]]      Go to the next section

**Insert Mode**

Ctrl-H    Delete one character

Ctrl-W    Delete one word

Ctrl-U    Delete the entire line

**Register**

Vim registers can store texts for future use. There are “Named Register” (a-z)

"ayiw -> 	•	"a tells Vim that the target of your next action will go to register a. & yiw yanks inner word. Review the chapter on Vim grammar for a refresher

Ctrl-R a -> to paste

delete - ~/.local/state/nvim folder and content inside it
